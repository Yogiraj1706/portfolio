            I completed an internship training program that focused on the
            fundamentals of Python programming and data structures. During this
            training, I gained hands-on experience in writing efficient code and
            applying programming concepts. It helped me strengthen my
            problem-solving abilities and improve logical thinking. Overall, the
            internship enhanced my practical coding skills and understanding of
            core programming principles.
